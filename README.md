Predicting Stroke Risk: A Logistic Regression Model for Early Detection and Prevention in Healthcare

I recently built a Logistic Regression Model to predict stroke risk in patients, this is a part of my Data Science journey at Southern Alberta Institute of Technology (SAIT).

This project has deepened my understanding of both supervised classification machine learning algorithms, focusing on early stroke detection. With an accuracy of 78%, this model can assist healthcare professionals in making informed, data-driven decisions, potentially saving lives.
